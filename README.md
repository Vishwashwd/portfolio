Hi! I’m Vishwash, a B.Tech Computer Science student. Let’s get straight to the point — the portfolio project you saw above was fully coded by me in VS Code after learning HTML. I’m currently learning CSS and experimenting with it to ensure I’m progressing well. I  made little CSS changes yet, but I will be updating the project soon to make it more professional and visually appealing.
