            <p class="bolding">
                Hi, I'm Vishwash — a B.Tech CSE student and a beginner web developer.
                I've completely learned HTML and I'm currently improving my skills in CSS and JavaScript.
                I also use Git and GitHub to manage my projects and track my progress as I grow in web development.
                Apart from coding, I'm an athlete and someone who actively works on building my physique.
                I'm continuously learning and improving so I can build better websites and grow as a web developer.
            </p>
